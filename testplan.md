# Test Plan
## Description

Our test plan will consist of two parts. The first being testing the individual elements of our product, such as class creation, account preferences, and many other features. We will also be testing each UI control to ensure a professional style remains. Abnormal testing will be used to try to break certain features or inputs. The second part of testing will  be creating sample data to utilize the app the same way our customers would (creating accounts, joining classes, posting to the calendar, etc.). This will ensure that the product is easy and functional for our customers and that it can handle the full load of what our customer needs.
