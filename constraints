Economic Costs:
- Server space could be an issue we run into in terms of finances

Time: 
- There should be no time issues that prevent our group from completing our final project

Scope: 
- Our team agrees on the scope and we have it laid out in our design

Professional/Technical: 
- Our product would need a team of system support in case of outages if it were to be used by customers

Ethical and Legal: 
- One concern would be academic dishonesty. Students should not be using this application to cheat in school
- If a product like this exists, we need to ensure we are not breaking copyright

Security:
- We need to ensure people cannot break into others' accounts and cause them to struggle academically due to a malicious attack

Social: 
- It will be used by students to help them stay organized and connected to their classes

Environmental: 
- There should be no environmental limitations or concerns for this project

Diversity and Cultural: 
- We need to ensure we have the ability to translate to different languages via google and adjust text size for people with poor eyesight
- A more wide reaching app means more people can benefit from our project
